 Support for the Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle
   Protocol and Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) Datagrams over
                                Ethernet

Abstract

   TODO Abstract

   Where two Bundle Protocol endpoints are connected by an Ethernet
   link, or by a link that emulates Ethernet, it may be possible to
   transmit bundles directly without additional converge layer adaptator
   (CLA) overhead.  This memo requests an EtherType for bundles and
   describes how bundles may be transmitted similar to existing datagram
   CLAs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

3.  General Recommendation

3.1.  Fragmentations

3.2.  Congestion Control

3.3.  Checksums

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

   Bundles transmitted over any link may be subject to observation and
   alteration.  Security must be applied to the bundle itself, either in
   the form of BPSec or at a layer below the transmition of bundles,
   e.g. 802.1AE MACsec.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
