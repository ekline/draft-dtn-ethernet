 Support for the Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle
   Protocol and Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) Datagrams over
                                Ethernet
                      draft-ek-dtn-ethernet-latest

Abstract

   When two Bundle nodes are connected by an Ethernet link, or by a
   logical link that emulates Ethernet, it may be possible for a Bundle
   Protocol Agent to transmit bundles directly over Ethernet, without
   higher layer Convergence-layer Adaptator (CLA) overhead.

   This memo specifies a CLA protocol for the encapsulation of Bundles
   and Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) segments over Ethernet,
   provides recommendations for operational considerations, and requests
   an EtherType for this protocol.

1.  Introduction

   When two Bundle nodes are connected by an Ethernet link, or by a
   logical link that emulates Ethernet, it may be possible for a Bundle
   Protocol Agent to transmit bundles directly over Ethernet, without
   higher layer Convergence-layer Adaptator (CLA) overhead.

   This memo specifies a CLA protocol for the encapsulation of Bundles
   and Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) segments over Ethernet,
   provides recommendations for operational considerations, and requests
   an EtherType for this protocol.

   The protocol described here is another datagram CLA, like those
   specified in [RFC7122].  It is in essence a reduced overhead version
   of [RFC7122]'s IP/UDP-based CLA (UDPCL), suitable for use only among
   directly-connected nodes (i.e. on-link communications only).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This specification is experimental and does not make use of normative
   language.

4.  Operational Considerations

4.1.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

4.2.  Congestion Control

4.3.  Checksums

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

   Bundles transmitted over any link may be subject to observation and
   alteration.  Security must be applied to the bundle itself, either in
   the form of BPSec or at a layer below the transmition of bundles,
   e.g. 802.1AE MACsec.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Type field

   TODO: IANA registry for Type field.

6.2.  Reserved field

   No IANA registry is requested for Reserved field values.  This is
   deferred to a future specification wishing to utilize this field.

6.3.  EtherType
