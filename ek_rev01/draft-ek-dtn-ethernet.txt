    Assignment of Ethernet Parameters for Bundle Transfer Protocol -

                      draft-ek-dtn-ethernet-latest

Abstract

   This memo requests Ethernet parameters for Bundle Transfer Protocol -
   Unidirectional [BTP-U] for use on Ethernet and Ethernet-like links.
   This is not intended to replace existing IP-based Convergence Layer
   (CLs).  Rather this makes it possible to use Ethernet with BTP-U as a
   CL in environments where Ethernet-like operation better matches the
   network infrastructure or operational constraints.

1.  Introduction

   When two Bundle nodes are connected by an Ethernet link, or by a
   technology can emulate aspects of Ethernet, it may be possible for a
   Bundle Protocol Agent to transmit Bundles in the payload of an
   Ethernet frame without higher layer protocol Convergence Layer (CL)
   overhead.  Examples of "Ethernet-like" Technologies include Digital
   Video Broadcast Generic Stream Encapsulation ([DVB-GSE]).

   This memo recommends use of Bundle Transfer Protocol - Unidirectional
   [BTP-U] for this purpose and requests some Ethernet parameters to
   support this, specifically: an EtherType for identifying frames
   carrying BTP-U payloads (3.1}) and a Multicast MAC address, for
   indicating the frame is addressed to all BTP-U capable receivers
   (3.2).

   While hypothetically applicable to a physical Ethernet LAN, it may
   find more use within Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, which
   allow novel software-define connectivity among a set of cooperating
   Bundle processing cloud compute nodes (i.e. VMs).  Such deployments
   can be useful for mission modeling, testbed activities, and may also
   integrate well with some Ground-Station-as-a-Service (GSaas) network
   infrastructure.

1.1.  Congestion Control

   BTP-U lacks a congestion control mechanism and presumes the sending
   rate is controlled by a lower layer or mechanism otherwise out of
   scope for BTP-U.

   Ethernet flow control mechanisms exist but, even if in use, they may
   not be sufficient to avoid significant loss of BTP-U frames in all
   situations.  Additionally, a Bundle Protocol Agent may not be able to
   easily determine whether any Ethernet-level flow control mechanism is
   available.

   For deployments where congestion control cannot be managed by a
   mechanism outside of BTP-U, network operators should to consider
   alternate Convergence Layers.

1.2.  Relationship to Other Convergence Layers

   This "Ethernet Convergence Layer" is not intended to replace IP-based
   CLs where their use would be more appropriate.  While use of direct
   encapsulation within an Ethernet frame avoids incurring some IP and
   UDP/TCP header overhead (28 to 48 bytes, or more, depending on
   Internet Protocol version and other options).  These savings,
   however, are not the primary motivation.  Rather, some Bundle
   Protocol deployments utilize links which may not have any operational
   IP addressing or routing.

   Convergence Layers like [TCPCL] and [DGRAMCL] have many useful
   features and are recommended wherever deployable.  This may include
   some links where only IPv6 Link-Local Addresses are available, though
   how a Bundle Protocol Agent obtains the IPv6 Link-Local Address of a
   peer is a deployment-specific matter.

2.  Assignment of an EtherType by IEEE

   The IESG is requested to approve applying to the IEEE Registration
   Authority for an EtherType for BTP-Y.  The IESG should communicate
   its approval to IANA and to those concerned with this document.  IANA
   will forward the IESG Approval to the registry expert of the
   "EtherType" registry from the "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry group who
   will make the application to the IEEE Registration Authority, keeping
   IANA informed.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Allocation of the following Ethernet parameters is requested.

3.1.  EtherType

   (if approved) The following entry has been added to the "ETHER TYPES"
   subregistry of the "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry [IANA-IEEE802]:

   Ethertype (decimal): YYYY Ethertype (hex): YYYY Exp. Ethernet
   (decimal): - Exp. Ethernet (octal): - Description: BTP-U payloads
   References: RFC ZZZZ (this document)

3.2.  Multicast MAC Address

   In order to identify "all Bundle Transfer Protocol - Unicast over
   Ethernet capable receivers" within a broadcast domain, IANA is
   requested to allocate one Multicast MAC address.

   Following the recommended format given as the EUI-48 Identifier
   template in [RFC9542]:

   Applicant Name: IETF DTN Working Group

   Applicant Email: dtn@ietf.org

   Applicant Telephone: (none)

   Use Name: Bundle Transfer Protocol - Unidirectional

   Document: [BTP-U]

   This memo is an application for one multicast EUI-48 identifier.

4.  Operational Considerations

   In addition to issue around congenstion control and lack of feedback
   about excess sending rate noted above (1.1), some addition
   operational considerations are noted below.

4.1.  Checksums

   To reiterate the observation in ยง3.5 of [DGRAMCL], the Bundle
   Protocol specifications assume that Bundles "are transmitted over an
   erasure channel, i.e., a channel that either delivers packets
   correctly or not at all".

   Ethernet's Frame Check Sequence (FCS) minimally meets this
   requirement to ensure Bundles are not corrupted in transmission.  Use
   of stronger integrity checks are left to BTP-U.

4.2.  Filtering

   A common security paradigm is to "defaul deny" all traffic patterns
   that, broadly, do not conform to operator expectations.  In such
   environments it may be that this document's new EtherType needs to be
   added to an allowlist or otherwise explicitly permitted to be used on
   a given Ethernet segment before Bundles can be successfully
   delivered.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document requests assignment of an EtherType and Multicast MAC
   address for BTP-U datagrams.  It has no incremental implications for
   security beyond those in the relevant protocols.

   BTP-U assumes sending rate is controlled by a mechanism out of scope
   for the protocol and has no builtin mechanism for identifying or
   mitigating any congestion a sender might cause.  Use of this protocol
   on some networks, a shared LAN segment for example, may cause a
   Denial-of-Service by flooding Ethernet switches and stations.

   Any attacker with access to the link, or with sufficient knowledge of
   local Bundle fordwarding configuration so as to inject BTP-U frames
   and cause them to be sent to an Ethernet peer, may overwhelm the
   receiver to the point of Denial of Service to other onlink senders.

   IEEE standards include several security mechanisms that may be used
   in Ethernet networks.  Examples of recommended Ethernet-level
   security mechanisms a network might deploy include: IEEE 802.1X
   (TODO: reference), which may be used restrict access to the link to
   authorized participants, and IEEE 802.1AE (TODO: reference), which
   would offers confidentiality of the entire BTP-U payload.
